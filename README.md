# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
I built an app that chooses a dish from three categories, or all three, for a user to cook. For example, if main dish is chosen and the button lets cook is clicked then the name of a dish will be displayed. The button can continously be clicked until the user finds a dish of their choice. 

### Installation Instructions:
If you want to use my app just click on the green <> Code button on the home page of whats-for-dinner, copy the SSH, open your terminal and type git clone (paste SSH) and run. If that has executed properly type open index.html in your terminal and hit enter.

### Learning Goals:
This project relly helped me solidfy some skills and ideas previously used on a random image project. Practice and repitition is very important so I'm glad I got to work on this project. 

### Wins + Challenges:
Some wins I had on this project were using HTML and CSS for the first time. It was fun getting my feet wet with those two languages. I'm really looking forward to expanding my CSS knowledge. Initially had some challenges moving some boxes around and then refactoring my javascript for sure.
